# Analyze the Effects of COVID-19 Lockdown on Air Pollution in LA County
This project aims to analyze the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on air pollution in LA County. The data are from government-sponsored websites that record weather and air quality.

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to provide as much analyzed information of the air quality data in LA County to help conclude if the lockdown regulations are a reasonable guess for a change in pollution. 

### Methods Used
- Data Visualization
- Correlation Plot
- ANOVA Test
- Permutation Test

### Technologies
- Python
- Numpy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn 
- Statsmodels, SciPy

## Project Description
For our project we decided to look at two important problems in the world right now: the COVID-19 pandemic and air pollution. We specifically focused on LA County, to figure out whether the COVID-19 lockdown regulations had contributed to an improvement in air quality. We started by visualizing and comparing the AQI levels of the pollutants pm2.5, O3, NO2, and CO, from the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. We found that three out of the four pollutants had a significant drop in 2020. We also analyzed weather trends in order to see if there was a major fluctuation which could have contributed to the significant drop in pollution in 2020. All in all, after considering possible confounding variables and performing multiple analyses to compare the pollution level between different years, we came to the conclusion that the regulations imposed by the COVID-19 lockdown is most likely the reason for the improvement in air quality in LA County.
